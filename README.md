# Conclusions
From a first website project perspective, I found this project extremely challenging and insightful. Putting theory into practice from the inital project conception, right through to publishing on Github pages is a huge learning curve. I would of course design this project completely different if I was to start again! However, through trial and error I hope to have increased my knoweldge dramatically...only time will tell!
Moving forward, need to improve on site structure in help reduce workload for site responsiveness.
Also need to improve on committing to Github in a more structured periodic fashion rather than at the end of every day!
