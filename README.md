## Code and CSS Styling
* Navingation menu styling, font awesome styling and social media links were taken from Code Institute Love Running project.
* Guidance on google maps and embedding a map on html was taken from The University of Maine blog named 'Plugged In: For UMaine Extension Staff & Volunteers'
* The image animation fading on the volunteer page was taken from GeeksforGeeks website, article called 'How to create fade-in effect on page load using CSS ?'.
* Background colouring insight taken from W3schools.com.

## Images

# Conclusions
* From a first project perspective, putting theory into practice proved both challenging and insightful. I would of course design this project completely different if I was to start again! However, through trial and error I hope to have increased my knowledge and understanding dramatically!
* Moving forward, I need to improve on the site structure to help reduce workload for site responsiveness.
I would also like to read up and improve on background colours and fonts.
I also need to improve on committing to Github, ideally in a more frequent fashion rather than at the end of every day!
